Circle-Dropping Web App
Overview
This web application allows users to interactively spawn circles on the screen that realistically obey Earth-like gravity. The circles fall vertically, bounce upon hitting the bottom of the screen, and exhibit a dampening effect on each bounce until they come to a stop. Users can also control the dampening effect using the arrow keys.

Features
Interactive Spawning: Click on the screen to spawn circles at the click location.
Realistic Physics: Circles fall and bounce realistically with Earth-like gravity.
Dampening Effect: Bouncing exhibits a dampening effect, reducing bounce height progressively.
User Interaction: Adjust dampening interactively using the arrow keys.
Visual Appeal: Subtle visual enhancements, including fading trails behind each circle.
Usage
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Click anywhere on the screen to spawn circles.
Use the arrow keys (ArrowUp and ArrowDown) to interactively control the dampening effect.
Files and Structure
index.html: HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
script.ts: TypeScript file containing the main logic for circle spawning, physics simulation, and user interaction.
style.css: CSS file for styling the web page.
README.md: Documentation providing an overview of the application and usage instructions.
Additional Considerations
Canvas Size: The canvas size adjusts dynamically to fit the entire window.
Circle Limit: The application is optimized to have a maximum of 15 circles on the screen at any time.
Responsive Design: The application is designed to be visually appealing and responsive to different window sizes.
